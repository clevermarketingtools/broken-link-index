The Broken Link Index is an example of a topic graph, derived from the Common Crawl Foundation's 2010 dataset.

At the time, the 2012 data was not available.

Each topic is connected to a broken link; an internet resource that has gone off the internet for one reason or another. The Broken Link Index was designed to be used for "Broken Link" based content strategy.

Essentially you identify broken links with high value content, and re-create them using resources such as the Internet Wayback Machine, and then contact sites linking to the dead resource, asking them to update their links to point to the new version.

It's built in Python, using MongoDB, Sentry on AWS, and released under an Apache License.

Originally we hoped to open source it and enter it in the Common Crawl Foundation's competition.

Now it's finally getting to see the light of day.

Stay tuned for better documentation.
